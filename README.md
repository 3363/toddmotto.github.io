# Todd Motto website (toddmotto.com)

The Jekyll build for [toddmotto.com](http://toddmotto.com), built on [FireShell](//github.com/toddmotto/fireshell).

> Be warned when forking this, the Grunt setup for this project kind of sucks. You'll spin up a local Jekyll server and it takes a few seconds to compile it, so you'll need to refresh a few times. CSS/JS/HTML compilation is slow but does the job.
