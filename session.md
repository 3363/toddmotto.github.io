Book a one-to-one development session with me on Google Hangouts or Skype. Sessions are booked in hourly slots and aim to help developers learn new technology, get code advice or help with anything they're working on.

### Topics
Sessions booked with me can cover any of the following topics:

* HTML5, semantics and APIs
* JavaScript and jQuery
* AngularJS
* CSS3/Sass/SCSS
* Frameworks/best practices/methodologies
* Scaffolding/workflow/tooling
* General questions on development/experience

Sessions can be on any project you're working on, website or application.

### Prices
Rates vary from $50USD - $250USD an hour depending on your requirements and business type. For instance if you're a student or freelancer, the rates would be lesser than a large corporation. I like to think this is a fair and relative pricing model.

### Booking
Make a booking by [dropping me an email](/contact) with the following details:

* Your name
* Job title + company
* Project requirements and what support you need
* How you think I can help you and how many sessions you think you'll need
* When you're available

### FAQs

#### What's the general setup of a session?
Whatever you'd like, I can assist with a pair-programming style session or simple guide you through learning languages, frameworks, best practices and much more. Generally I'd help with any issues and provide any support related help, which definitely includes just asking loads of questions.

#### How long do sessions last?
As long as you need, sessions are a minimum of 1 hour and can be booked in the hourly chunks you need.

#### Is it just one-to-one?
Doesn't have to be, you can involve as many people as you like, prices will increase slightly as more people are added however.

#### Can you come teach me/us something on site?
I'd be open to discussing teaching groups/teams either remotely or on site, wherever you're based. I've taught [AngularJS at Google](//speakerdeck.com/toddmotto/angularjs-in-one-day) so far.

#### Can you just code something for me?
I'd advise sessions over me simple providing a solution as you'll learn a lot more. Sessions can be used for me to provide coding assistance however in cases such as overflow, though should only be kept to a few hours.

#### How are payments made?
Payments are made via PayPal or if you're in the US/UK invoices can be arranged.

#### When should payments be made?
Payments should be made at least 24 hours before the sessions. I'm adopting this model to prevent any disputes or time wasters.

#### Are sessions refundable?
Sessions are refundable, but in hourly chunk. For example, in a 2 hour session, if you're unhappy then only 1 hour will be refunded. Let me know as soon as possible if things aren't to your liking.

#### What if you don't know something?
I'll let you know beforehand once you've emailed me with your requirements.

#### Are sessions confidential?
Yes. Nothing is shared publically unless you want to share what we're collaborating on.
