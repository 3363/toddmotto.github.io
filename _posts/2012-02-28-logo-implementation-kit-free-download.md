The idea for the Logo Kit sparked from a previous article [*The Future of Branding: Brand Squares*][1] – which touched on the importance of applying logos inside square elements. This article takes that concept one step further and I’ve created a set of Logo Kit templates available for free download, to use for yourself, clients and any other project.

### What Is The Logo Kit?

The Logo Kit is a logo dimension framework that helps you define your next customers (or your own) logos in leading social network formats. The kit incorporates major social networks and dimensions for precise logo implementation and is fully editable in vector format (Adobe Illustrator CS-CS5). Simply drag and drop your client’s logos into it – then take it to your next meeting. Use the kit to impress them, show your forward thinking and future preparation for their upcoming brand. It’s also a great tool to ensure your client’s logo isn’t excessive in length, and sits perfectly in the Logo Kit.

### Best Logo Kit Uses:

*   Use it alongside designing logos, they *need* to fit on social networks these days [*(here’s why)*][1] 
    *   Take it to client meetings, print it out/send them a PDF of their logos for social networks
    *   Run new branding tests for yourself and personal projects
    *   Use it with every logo project, it saves a tonne of time! 
    ### What’s Inside?
