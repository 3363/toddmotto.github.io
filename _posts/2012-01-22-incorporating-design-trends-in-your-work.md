Learning how to implement design trends into your work can be tough. Some let trends influence their design, and others simply copy. In order to become a better designer and broaden your horizons, you must allow trends to merely influence your style, not define it. Here’s how to avoid the ‘trend trap’, and continue being a great designer. 

### So, What’s A Trend?

A trend is a general direction in which things are going. This could be with typefaces, colors, layouts, backgrounds, CSS tricks, you name it. Design trends change so fast that we shouldn’t be heavily guided by them as our work can take a rapid spiral into 0% creativity.

### Be Inspired

When you come across a new trend and really go ‘wow’ – it’s most likely you’re going to bookmark it and save it for gazing at later. But how seriously should you take the trend? Will it change soon? Does it even look that good? Are you only liking it because everyone else does? Have a think. You should only be inspired by trends, not be cheering that you’ve found something else to base your work on. Be inspired to create better.

### Why You Shouldn’t Base Your Work On Trends

*   Everyone uses them
*   They’re never unique
*   Work will all end up similar
*   Creativity will plummet
*   You’ll only redesign when the next thing comes out
*   Client work will not be delivered to spec

### Don’t Let It Get To You

As hard as it is, you just want to incorporate that new trend into your next design. But you shouldn’t. Hold off, see what you can do without it, because you were perfectly okay without it before it came along, right? Let your own creativity speak up before diving into the easy option.
