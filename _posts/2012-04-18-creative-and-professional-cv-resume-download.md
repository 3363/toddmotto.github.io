After a quick revamp of my own CV/Résumé, I thought it’d be a great opportunity to release the template for anyone to use. CV/Résumé’s tend to be pretty time consuming to create, without the added fuss of having to design the thing. So here’s my solution – but it’s not just a default simple template, it’s got some added features which I think really set it apart from the rest.

### Features Overview

Personal Information Box:  
I’ve included a photograph on mine, it’s good to be friendly and open about who you are, they’ll only type your name in Google, so do the work for them! You’ve got a fresh layout with your main details accompanying your photo in a tidy box which attracts subtle attention.

Social Links & QR Code Positioning:  
I feel this is a really important include, and a great way to get some use out of QR Codes. To generate free QR Codes (in vector and other great formats) use [this link][4]. You’ve also got room to add in your (more professional) social media links and Skype. A lot of recruitment agencies use Skype nowadays so it’d be wise to setup a [free account][5].

Crystal Clear Layout:  
There’s nothing worse than being unsure what to do with your layout, so I’ve stripped everything down to barebones, which allows for the major details to stand out. I’ve cut down on pointless lines, dividers, blocks and kept the design as minimal as possible. This will benefit you when your potential employer/recruiter is running through various CV/Résumé’s

More Personal Experience:  
I’ve included some logos from past companies that I’ve worked at, it’s a great way to showcase your experience in a richer way, instead of pages and pages full of boring old text.

You’ll also note I’ve included a section for References. Don’t simply put ‘Available upon request’. Get one step ahead and always have a reference at hand. I’ve also linked some of my Client and Colleague Testimonials to my website, which is also great for that added credibility.
