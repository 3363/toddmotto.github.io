### What inspired you to start working in the creative industry?

Star Wars and going to see Hamlet at the age of 16.

### Where do you see yourself in five years?

Hopefully still touring live work and also writing and directing films. Working internationally. A glamourous award ceremony or too wouldn’t go amiss. And still having a full head of hair would be nice.

### Describe your usual working day.

There is no such thing! One of the most enjoyable aspects about my job is that it is like having a paid hobby and each day is very different. Some days it is all about scripting or rehearsing and other days might involve a variety of meetings and other days may be the “nuts and bolts” of a business with funding applications or strategic planning. Most days will start with Dan and I having a chat, catching up on news having a good whinge and making each other laugh.

### How do you stay focused during the day?

We have a sign up in our office reminding us of the difference Kronos time, and Kairos time. It depends what task is at hand; if my focus is wavering sometimes then I move on to something else or take a break. Other times I know a deadline has to be met and I remind myself of what the point is, what needs to be achieved and how I’m going to do it. If I’m writing then often I need to limit distractions and plenty of thought goes into a suitable playlist! We also have a visual approach in the office and so lists writing up and displayed help as visual reminders.

### What’s your most exciting project to work on?

Again, it’s fortunate that I get to work on a variety of projects so the type of excitement varies. For example, working on something like “24 hour Performance People” where we created and performed a new performance piece in just 24hours was exhilarating in a scary kind of way whereas performing our new touring piece “MAN” was exciting in a calm, focused way. Generally I like the start of projects. That phase where you generate ideas, explore possibilities and engage in play is the most exciting. I find this is the same whether it’s working on a new live piece, a short film or a sitcom idea.

### What’s the hardest part of your job?

1.  Funding
2.  Marrying imagination with practicalities
3.  Managing time
4.  Resisting the temptation to eat biscuits all day

### How do you think agency life differs to freelancing/self employment?

I’ve never done agency work but I do know that although freelancing/self employment can feel stressful it also puts the control in your own hands a bit more.

### How much time a week do you allocate to personal skill development?

There’s never a dedicated time but today is a good example. I have some editing to do for a job and I know there are a couple of things I would like to try and that will be a good learning opportunity. Likewise, I am reading some different scripts and really looking at how other writers use structure ahead of a writing session next week.

### Do you pay attention to theatre/film industry trends – if so, how much?

I often feel like I should pay way more attention but then a part of me prefers to focus on our work and not be influenced too heavily by trends. The only trend I see is that strong work succeeds more often than rubbish and if we can focus on honing our own voice and style and maintaining high quality control that means we enjoy the work we create then we have a good chance of being successful.

### Do you think what you do can be self-taught?

I’m a big believer in learning through doing. I learnt how to direct through putting on plays and I learnt filmmaking and editing through picking up a camera and blagging Adobe Premier software. Everyone has different approaches though and for some people a creative writing course or a Uni degree or a placement is exactly the right thing to do. Being self aware enough and honest enough to know how you best learn is probably the most important thing to learn.

### Do you feel up-and-coming creatives need a high level qualification to get hired?

Not at all! Demonstrating you have the right skills and are committed are probably top of the list for us. A qualification might help to show your commitment and the skills you have and the quality of your work but that could just as easily come across in other experience you have gathered or work you’ve produced. People that are reliable, enthusiastic, passionate and focused are worth way more than anyone with a degree who is lacking in those same areas.

### Finally, what is one piece of advice you would give anyone interested in becoming a writer/director?

Finish something and put it on. Speak to other people, build up contacts who can help put on a small performance or make a little film. Make things happen. The world is full of people with ideas and no little talent who wait and wait and then turn to someone who does something and say “you’re so lucky.”

It’s incredibly hard work and only a handful of people out of millions get “lucky”. Does that count as just one piece of advice? Yeah, work hard and do something! Even if it’s crap, you’ll learn and move on.
