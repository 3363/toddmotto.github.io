A Brand Square is actually something I have coined a name for in recent months after continuously battling with a method of keeping modern branding consistent, whilst being recognisible. With so many mediums that logos are being applied to, it’s almost impossible for brands to maintain their own identity in a way that evolves with the fast-paced digital world. In short, a Brand Square is a logo in it’s simplest form, inside a square. It only makes sense to adopt this new idea, and here’s why.

### Here a Square, There a Square

Across the web, in all shapes and sizes, are websites, blogs, social networks, forums, and so on. But what’s the best way to recognise your favourite brand or business you follow? What’s the best way to get your business recognised? In it’s simplest form of course, that people can instantly see. And remember. Take a piece, a part, a small chunk of your brand, blow it up, get creative, see what you can do with it, does it create an impact that can be used to identify you in a single Brand Square? See below for some obvious Brand Square examples:

On your **iPhone**, or other **SmartPhone** with App/Homescreen Saving Capabilities:

In your **Twitter** newsfeed:

Even in the smallest of places, these are known as **Favicons** to those unfamiliar with their name:

### So Why Do You Need One?

Brand Squares prove your business is forward thinking, stepping ahead to make your brand future proof for what’s still to come. They help **protect** your current brand by pushing you infront of those who haven’t adopted them yet. This means you get the chance to establish your digital Brand Square presence first. Not only that, as you modernise and evolve your brand, your business will evolve too. Everything is becoming more compact, and I believe branding will only become simpler.

It’s not about huge billboards as the casual motorist breezes past and struggles to read your ad, it’s about getting infront of the customers, in the palm of their hands, in the feeds of their social media accounts, and being instantly recognised in that busy place. Things will only get busier as technology and the internet grows. If you’re in it for the long-run, Brand Squares are for you.
