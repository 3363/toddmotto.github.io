Just under a year ago I released [HTML5 Blank](//html5blank.com), an HTML5 WordPress boilerplate for kickstarting projects. It started as a bit of fun to start my frequent WordPress projects, and since it's release has gained massive popularity within the web development industry and is ranked the 200,000th top site worldwide, seems crazy for a one-page landing site. It's also been downloaded thousands and thousands of times, [improved](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) very frequently (thank you community!), and coming up to 500 watchers on the GitHub project.

HTML5 Blank has proved to be one of the top choices to starting WordPress projects, and after some opinionistic coding and best-practices, it's moulded itself into a pretty awesome pre-loaded shell. Pushed to the world via .NET Magazine, Smashing Magazine, SpeckyBoy and many many others, Adobe eventually tweeted it - that was the killer moment and I know it had turned into something worthwhile...

The point of my post is; I rarely build WordPress websites anymore. I'm no longer actively keeping up-to-date with WordPress, I update the front-end HTML5 bare-bones within HTML5 Blank and refactor CSS/HTML and add new HTML5 practices when available, but the WordPress APIs and functionality I'm slowing dropping out the loop due to my idleness in the WordPress dev-scene.

If you're up for the challenge, I'm looking for:

1. An open source advocate who loves WordPress and is actively involved in API/system updates
2. Strong love for HTML5 technology
3. Great ideas and discussion skills to talk through new HTML5 Blank releases
4. Potentially assist with any comments on the landing page
5. Advice on anything else

And of course, I will credit you (profile shot, short bio) on the HTML5 Blank site with your specific role in maintaining the project, which will likely be a good traffic driver.

If that sounds like fun to you and you think you're the right person, drop a comment below, or email me via my [contact page](//toddmotto.com/contact) to chat more. Happy coding!
