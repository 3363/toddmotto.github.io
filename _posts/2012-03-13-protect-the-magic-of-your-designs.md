Designers are not generally hired to simply make something look nice, we’re the magic in the middle of an idea that takes it from a concept to a piece of graphical genius. Design can be immensely challenging, and it requires great skill and detail to produce something outstanding. Is it right to allow clients access to the files that helped you solve their problem?

### Intro

Design can be taught, (the use of software tools that is and a rough process). But creativity speaks for itself. How creative are you? Do you admire your designs with a passion? If you’re proud of your designs, your methods, your ways – you may be skeptical about simply ‘giving’ away your creation. Here are some ideas on the best ways to protect your creations in all scenarios – but still giving the client what they want.

### Scenario #1 – Artwork Transferred – Markup Magic

If your client requires all native artwork upon project closure, then you need to include a markup fee for this in your price. Your ideas and creativity are worth more than the finished product. When others look into your native files can also give away your ideas, your style, method and craft. You are a unique designer – don’t give your ideas away.

To avoid the risk of negative debate, include it in your written contract/agreement. Let them know before the project begins that only merged/flattened files are sent across, and raw files will cost extra. I personally believe it’s a great idea to offer *some* files, such as Business Cards, so they can reprint them as and when they are required, without needing you. Be smart, but generous.

### Scenario #2 – No Layers – Merged Magic

Merged layered files are a great win for sending over to clients for multiple reasons. They’re uneditable in raw format, the client receives a pretty hands on file where the original artwork was created, and finally and most importantly they receive a sense of ownership. None of your original tweaks, effects, layers and so on are included. Think of it as a frozen image, they can look, but they can’t really touch, which protects you against the possibility of another designer using them in future by just tweaking your designs. Secure your future work without even thinking about it.

### Scenario #3 – No Sending – My Magic

If you’re really not massively keen on giving away any type of working files, remember to include it in your written agreement and you will cover yourself should a disagreement situation arise. If you’ve a long working relationship with the client, it is probably easier for you to simply hang onto the mass of files. This is also great as you could sell secure server backups services to the client for archiving their previous work.

### Outro

If the client wants, the client usually gets. There’s no point sparking debate over a few files, just make sure you’re not missing out on potential money in the future, and if you might be – make sure you’re getting rewarded for it. There may be times that you allow exceptions, purely because of the client relationship or other reasons such as pro bono/non-profit work. If you are, then it’s definitely a great thing to supply them with all the files they need and will need in the future. Give and you will receive.
