The key features to a successful marketing site include a great portfolio and service offering, topped off with a streamlined and informative contact page. A simple contact form isn’t enough – nor is just leaving an email address. It’s often underrated – but a fantastic contact page is what will seal you the deal with new customers, everytime. 

### The importance of guidance

Imagine someone giving you a business card with all their details on – mobile, home phone, office, receptionist, Facebook profile, LinkedIn profile, Twitter profile, and so on. Where do you start? What do you even say? Help your customers contact you with confidence by giving them guidance. You need to lay out all the reasons they would need to contact you for, ranging from customer service all the way to new project enquiries.

### Essential includes

Your contact page can say a lot about your business, make it personal and be transparent. Include your office address, a few general email accounts, such as sales, customer service, info, and so on. Only you know which ones you need. Include your social media links (don’t over do it), your office number(s), maybe even a snapshot of your office building, inside the office – just to add that ‘we are real’ touch to your site. People will trust you more!

### To form, or not to form

I’m a firm believer that every contact page should have some sort of form. Simple forms often leave the reader guessing who their message is going to, which may leave them feeling a little uneasy. As we don’t want that happening, let’s introduce a system that allows them to contact who they want, about what they want. This will have them leaving our websites in confidence as they anticipate a reply. A form offers so many possibilities, drop-downs, checkboxes, project budget, estimated timescales – and even extra data like how they found you, their web address, and so on. Before starting any project, you’ll gather information from your customers, so why not grab some of the vital, yet basic, stuff upfront?

### Be honest

If your company has a customer service department, tailor your form and include the top 5 reasons people contact you. Don’t worry if one of these is for complaints, make sure complaints is easily listed – you don’t want to make it difficult for your customers to contact you.

### Streamline for success

Think sensibly, the person filling out your contact page is probably in a bit of a rush. They’re possible contacting a few other designers or companies too, why would they want to spend so much time on just your form? You can risk losing a customer before you’ve even got them. It’s a good idea to get a few people to (properly) fill out your contact form, by providing a few testing scenarios to friends, family, colleagues. For example; you’re a Marketing Director at a large Manufacturing company, with a £10,000 budget, and you want to develop a new brand identity and website. See how fast they can realistically input this data into your form, and send it across to you. Adjust the form as per their feedback on what could be done to make it easier, and streamline it!
