Angular 1.x is paving the way towards Angular 2, and doing some fantastic cleanup work and refinement in the meantime. An interesting [change just landed](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/9cd9956dcbc8382e8e8757a805398bd251bbc67e) in Angular `1.5.3` that brings new lifecycle hooks to Angular 1.x.

This change brings a _very_ important architectural change to our Angular Directives and Components, so listen closely.
