### What inspired you to start working in the creative industry?

I started out working in advertising sales for a local newspaper, and was drawn to ad design. I constantly would open the design files and try changing things on my own. The graphic designers eventually showed me how to make the changes, and I loved it. I went out and got my first PowerBook, installed all the programs and taught myself how to design everything from ads to brochures and business cards.

### Where do you see yourself in five years?

Ideally, I would love to be still working full time in a freelance gig, helping clients with their brand issues and possibly owning my own Brand Agency.

### Describe your usual working day.

I get up early and spend an hour working out and get into my home office by 9 a.m. at the latest. I’ll check emails and my social media profiles. Then I make a list and prioritize it to know what has to get done that day and what can wait. I’ll work on one task at a time, taking a small 5-10 minute break between them. Around noon or 1 p.m. I’ll break for lunch, and then am back at it an hour later. I like to spend time each day connecting with people, so usually the afternoons are spent communicating with other designers, contacting clients and potential clients and texting or chatting with a friend or two. I will get back to design work roughly around 3 p.m. and work another few hours. I like to end each design day by updating my list of what needs to get done over the next few days.

Sometimes I work later, depending on the project deadline and how my week is looking.

### How do you stay focused during the day?

It’s easy for me to get distracted, so I turn off notifications on my phone, close my email client, sign out of all social media sites, turn on some music and work on a task. Once that task is finished, I reward myself with checking email and Facebook/Twitter. Those little breaks help me stay focused and tackle my to-do list.

### What’s your most exciting project to work on?

I love working on any Brand Identity project. There’s just something about helping a business or organization find their look that appeals to me. The look in a client’s eyes when it all comes together and they give that emphatic “yes!” energizes me. 

### What’s the hardest part of your job?

As a freelance graphic designer, the hardest part is getting my name out there and trying to land some of the bigger projects. I don’t particularly like doing collections, either.

### How do you think agency life differs to freelancing/self employment?

I have never worked as a graphic designer in an agency, but I would gather the main difference is the paycheck security. My income is based on the projects I get in and complete each month, so it fluctuates month to month.

### How much time a week do you allocate to personal skill development?

It depends on how busy I am during that week, but I try to develop my skills quite a bit. I like to get into my web sites and play around with some coding. I search the internet for design ideas and try to replicate something I’ve never done before. The biggest thing for me is just to get in and try something new. I’m more of a hands on learner, so that helps develop my skills the most.

### Do you pay attention to design trends – if so, how much?

I do keep an eye on current trends, but I’m not engrossed in them. I believe design should be clean and timeless. Many trends fade out in a year or two, and give those design items a dated look.

### Do you think design and branding skills can be self-taught?

I am the product of being self-taught in design and branding consultation, so I do believe it can be. I mixed up my training by just trying things out and having good friends who are in the design industry give me advice and help when needed.

### Do you feel up-and-coming creatives need a high level qualification to get hired?

I don’t believe creatives need to have a high level qualification, as some of the best ones are self-taught. However, I’ve noticed that many agencies right now won’t hire you without some kind of formal training (unless, of course, you have a killer portfolio). I believe that trend will change in upcoming years, as we have more access to faster and less expensive training than a formal, 4 year degree offers.

### Finally, what is one piece of advice you would give anyone interested in becoming a designer?

Start small and build your portfolio. Ask your friends and relatives if they have any design needs. Offer to do some work for them at a discounted rate. Your bigger clients will want to see a portfolio of your work to show that you are capable of doing what they want. Play around in the programs you use, learn them and, if you have time, mock up some practice designs. The more practice you get, the better.
