If you’re new to freelancing or an up-and-coming design hero, this post is for you. It’s also the first of a series of Freelance articles that cover a bunch of tips and resources to get the average Joe out there making his mark on the design world. There is nothing better than advice from someone who’s “been there, done that” – so here’s my take. Caution: may cause sleepless nights. 

### What Do You Want To Achieve?

Let’s be honest, you’re really excited about getting out there, earning some cash, and leading the ‘designers life’ of drinking coffee in Starbucks with your shiny Mac. But before jumping in, take a step back as there’s a lot to consider before you can even think this far ahead. What’s your longterm goal? Be sure to establish your route first – there are usually three scenarios:

*   Freelance for life!
*   Gain clients, get experience, talk to agencies, get hired!
*   Gain clients, get experience, start design agency!

### Scoring Easy Clients

It’s often underrated, but open your eyes a little, talk to your family members, who do you know in your family who has their own business, or knows someone who has their own business? Offer them a free rebrand/website (whatever you specialise in) and make sure you impress the hell out of them, they’ll only come back to you asking for more work once they see the value of great design. Getting your family members to chat to their friends is usually an automatic yes as there is a bond between them. Gaining clients is all about building relationships and creating your own network. Usual outcome: They will refer you to other business owners and ask you for more design work on an ongoing basis.

### The Sales Approach

Now that you’ve got a few credible Portfolio pieces on your website, be sure to have a sales plan in place. This normally is tied in with a business plan, with your 3 year projection on sales targets and profits. If you haven’t heard of the [Business Link][1], it’s a Government run website to help with business support, advice and tonnes of information, be sure to bookmark it. Your sales plan will need to consist of all the available routes to market yourself, and an analysis of the best routes to take. Just a few options to start your mind-map:

*   Design flyers, print flyers, distribute flyers
*   Scope out local businesses and email them explaining what you do
*   Same as above, but call them instead, get the owners details and email your services/portfolio
*   Attend local networking events/conferences (remember the business cards!)
*   Chat with strangers more, sounds creepy, but get into business chat (i.e. at Train stations)
*   Optimise your website for local area searches

### Know Your Place, But Take A Dive

It may be scary getting your first proper client, or even your first lead – but at the same time it’s incredibly exciting. Knowing your place in the market is key to picking clients that are right for you. When you’re first starting out, you’ll want to get in touch with small companies, plumbers, one man bands and independent companies. You’ll need to build up a range of clients and have the right experience before contemplating a pitch to larger firms, because you only get one shot per company. It’s always a great idea to partner with other designers (local, national or global) to assist you on projects – cover your back incase you hook a big fish.

### Use Time and Money Wisely

It may be tempting, but designing yourself business cards, letterheads, brochures, websites, Twitter and Facebook accounts (to name a few) can be your biggest distraction and downfall when trying to generate leads. Concentrate on the bare essentials you need to get going, as the more time you use up – the more opportunities are being taken by another designer/agency. Print out a few business cards, get a website online – and start selling.
