Once you’ve set the idea of freelancing, it’s tough to get it out your mind. To continue doing what you love, you need focus, attention, discipline – and clients under your belt to keep your business running successfully. Following from my [previous article][1], *#1 Game Plan*, next up in the Guide To Freelancing series, comes *#2 Client Retention*, where I will be explaining how you can benefit over retaining your new clients each month, in order to keep freelancing with a smiley face.

### How Does It Work?

There are several different ways you can retain your clients, and this needs to be based on their ongoing requirements. This is usually done with a Retainer Fee for an agreed period of time, at an agreed cost. The usual scenario is that you’ll allocate X amount of hours/work to them each month, at a higher priority level, in return for a steady payment from them.

### Loyalty

You’ll always remember your customers, that’s because they helped you get you where you are (or on your path of where you want to be). As you grow in skill, service offering, and size (utilising other creatives for bigger business), your prices will most likely rise too. It’s important to treat your first customers with that personal touch you first started out with, and you’re bound to keep them as a forever-client. Be loyal to your customers and they will be loyal to you. Focus most of your time, efforts, and resources on better serving your current clients. Go deeper rather than wider.

### Be Invaluable

Don’t just be a designer, developer or whatever you specialise in – be a resource. Be their go-to man, when they need help you’re there to advise as well as deliver. Treat your clients with honesty, humour, and respect – and keep it up over time. Always present a consistent, solid, and professional style to your clients – one that they can grow to depend on and make it hard for them to live without you. When you’ve solidified yourself as an external part of their team, they’re yours for the long run.

### Are You Offering Enough?

If you’re a digital design/developer/web geek of any kind, it’s important you’re not missing out on any services that you could be upselling on – and more importantly your customer might be missing out on. Give current and prospective clients a brochure and ensure your site goes deep enough to explain all the little services you might do. Don’t just put ‘Web Design’. An example of a great retained piece of business is utilising Analytics and Reporting. No stress, no new ideas, just give them an analysis of their site traffic, visitor data, and offer suggestions on improvements with small campaigns that will look to increase traffic (and decrease bounce rates) in certain pages. There are tonnes of possibilities for helping out your client with smaller jobs, that will definitely benefit them. Find out what they need internally, how big is their team? Do they need recurring business card orders and so on?

### Final Notes: Don’t Underestimate Time and Work Overflow

Workload plays a massive part in how many clients you can retain each month. It’s important to remember that freelancing comes with a lot of administrative work, which sadly means less time in the design suite and coding apps. Meetings, phone calls emails, expenses and general admin – it’s very time consuming and can take up anywhere from 20% to 50% of your daily time. My recommendation is to partner up with some other freelance designers to manage your workloads and bounce off each other. There will be times when you’re maxed out, but that’s all part of the parcel. When you start generating bigger sales, you could look to outsource one day a week to manage the admin for you.
