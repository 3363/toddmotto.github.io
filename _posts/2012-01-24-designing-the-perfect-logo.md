A logo is an important, often overlooked, business asset. It’s not suddenly going to change the planet, drive thousands of sales, or even make people gasp in awe. It’s simply used for identification of a business, to help build a brand and recognition. Over the years I’ve been actively involved with a vast amount of logo design projects, and I’ve put together a nice recipe for what I call, the perfect logo.

### 1. Typeface

Starting off with the basics, a good logo needs the right typeface. A typeface can set the mood, tone and direction of the whole project, so make sure you research into your client’s requirements before getting started to gain the right information you need. Thinking about updating your font collection? Check out [Font Squirrel][1] for a bunch of hand picked fonts that are entirely free for commercial and personal use.

### 2. Create The Identifiable Asset

So what is an identifiable asset? It’s the image that springs to mind when I say ‘Apple’ or ‘McDonalds’. It’s any part of a company branding that you will recognise without it physically saying ‘Apple’ or ‘McDonalds’. For instance, the bitten/cutout Apple logo, and the golden arches of McDonalds. We all know what they stand for. You should always be looking to include an identifiable asset within your logo designs. But just one. Any more than one and you’ll have to give the audience another asset to remember, which can deteriorate the message in your first asset.

### 3. K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple Stupid.

I’m often told my designs are clean, fresh and iconic. Why? Because I keep things as light and as simple as possible. Not every design needs dazzling detail and overthought process, in fact most don’t. If things get messy with your designs, ask yourself ‘Do I really need that bit?”. If the logo looks fine without it, strip it out. By reducing the clutter and complexity of your logo, it allows for your client’s logo to really strive and become an even more important asset to them.

### 4. Future Use

There’s more? When creating your logo design, don’t just live in the moment and sit there looking forward to your pay cheque. Take some real pride in what you are about to create, and think about it’s future use. The logo might look great on it’s own, but what about that awesome looking brochure you’re going to pitch for next month? Creating a logo that can easily be adapted, scaled and played with will benefit you and the client at the same time. You’ll be able to get more creative with future designs, and they’ll reap the rewards of a flexible logo as their brand grows.
