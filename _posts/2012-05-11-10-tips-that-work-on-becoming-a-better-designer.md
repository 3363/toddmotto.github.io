Here’s ten tips I’ve put together from my own experiences that will definitely work on helping you become a better design.

### 1. Have Passion in Your Style

Each and every one of us has our own style. Think about how much better we all perform when it’s something we’re passionate about. Define your own style and pursue it. It will evolve and become better. Don’t be tempted to deviate from your natural creativity. Stick with your own style, but make sure your work is relevant for the client (not your Portfolio).

### 2. Ignore your Taste

Learning to differentiate your style and taste will enable you to stop doing what you ‘want to design like’ (because you favour the look), and providing a solution that fits the client’s requirements, but done in your own style. They’re two important factors to mastering your own style, yet being able to provide flexible solutions for your clients.

### 3. Work in an Agency

It may be fun doing freelance gigs, but it can be restricting in terms of client breadth and project experience. Working in an agency really helps diversify your work. Beforehand where you could select the clients yourself, having ‘no choice’ but to complete projects is great for getting inspired as well as building your confidence outside of your comfort zone.

### 4. Specialise in Something Else

Everyone’s got a core area of expertise that they feel comfortable working within. Try something new and you’ll broaden your opportunities. This may be with coding, using a different piece of design software, or simply replicating a design (for fun purposes) that someone else has done. This helps you try out new techniques that you never knew you could execute. Even if you’re not great at it – stick at it and you’ll enhance your skills.

### 5. Use Colour Palettes

Even the simplest of ideas can create great results (more often than not the best results), so start from the very basics of creating a colour palette, and create some ‘themed’ designs using those specific colours. Be strict, choose from 2-5 different swatches, and create yourself a poster, a logo, or a website design – and just stick to those colours. Restricting your use of colours allows you to be more creative in output.

### 6. Keep Learning

It sounds cliché and people say it all the time, don’t just ‘let’ things happen, ‘make’ them happen by being proactive about your skills. Look ahead and set a longterm vision for your career, and think what you need to do to get there. Diversify your skills and you will grow as a designer by ‘finding out’ new things.

### 7. Start a Design Blog

It’s really quite difficult to talk about what you do, and put it into words that people can relate to and understand. It’s often a challenge to think of new content, and guide others. Expressing your creativity in words instead of graphics will allow you to think a little differently on your approach to design, and allows you to realise more capability.

### 8. Use Pencil and Paper

Let’s face it, with the introduction of computers our lives have been made easier. They’re pretty functional and can create fantastic things in a fraction of the time our own hands can. But that’s not to say they’re better in creative output. Grabbing a pencil and sketching out ideas is a great way to put the computer down and really think about what you’re going to create. I believe it’s a lot harder, but definitely an eye opener (not literally).

### 9. Give and Receive Feedback

To give and take ‘constructive criticism’ is a challenge. A challenge to give, and sometimes hard to swallow. When receiving feedback, ask what the other person would suggest to improve it, don’t simply nod with their “I don’t like this bit…” comments. When you’re giving feedback, offer your suggestions and tread carefully, you don’t want to upset the person. They place trust in you when asking for feedback (they value your opinion!) – so be true and think about what you’re going to suggest before you say it.

### 10. Have a Motivator

For me, it’s music. I can sit all day listening to music whilst working as it helps me concentrate and get ‘wired in’. Being able to concentrate on the day ahead, yet enjoy it at the same time (even when there’s pressure to deliver) is great as it keeps you calm and level headed. Who likes an awkward silence anyway combined with the tapping of keyboards?
