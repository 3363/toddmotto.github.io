Today’s interview features Lucy Clemson as we uncover her life as Postmistress at RSVP London.

### What inspired you to start working in the creative industry?

I grew up in an artistic and musical family, so felt confident I’d end up doing something creative, I always made invitations to my own events, but when I got together with my partner Omar, I was suddenly sending over a hundred (we have the same birthday, so large joint parties became a tradition!). Friends we’d invited would ask me to create invites for them, and as word spread it became clear that there was a real desire out there for something totally different and entirely bespoke. I took that as my cue to fill the gap.

### Where do you see yourself in five years?

I love what I do, so can only hope I’m still doing it, though perhaps with more time for the odd holiday (I haven’t managed more than four days away since the business took off in 2007).

### Describe your usual working day.

There’s no such thing as a typical day at RSVP… I usually begin by checking my emails over a coffee, but then it’s onto whatever is most urgent – whether that’s travelling for a client meeting, devising concepts for different briefs, or out buying materials. I’m also often hand-finishing various projects, which will usually need to be couriered to the client as soon as they’re finished.

### How do you stay focused during the day?

The quantity and urgency of the projects I’m working on at once (anything up to 21!) are enough to keep me focused. My biggest motivator is urgency.

### What’s your most exciting project to work on?

Projects for clients I know well, and who are happy to try the more adventurous stuff – pop ups, or rubber python invites, for example! Once I’ve worked with a client I’m fairly good at tuning into what they like – going away to devise a range of ideas for them is great because I know exactly what will get them really excited, and that’s infectious!

### What’s the hardest part of your job?

Time, or lack of it. I’m very fortunate to work with amazing clients and brands I adore, but most approach me in less than ten days from when they need to have their invitations. I’m usually working on between five and fifteen projects at any one time, so it’s hard when the client gets in touch at short notice.

### How do you think agency life differs to freelancing/self employment?

I’ve been self-employed for six years. Nothing beats the feeling of working for yourself. Every victory (and equally, every hiccup!) is taken to heart, but the knowledge that your own success is in your own hands is such a driver and nothing motivates me more.

### Do you pay attention to design trends – if so, how much?

I pay some attention to industry trends, but I wouldn’t say I’m particularly influenced by them. If something is a trend, it usually turns me off wanting to produce ideas in the same style. The service I offer is bespoke, so what I make is ultimately up to the client, but I prefer originality over popularity.

### Do you think what you do can be self-taught?

I didn’t train to do this, so am living proof of that. But this is my passion and I’ve been creative ever since I can remember. Everyone needs to make the most of the ‘raw ingredients’ and talents they have, and mine happen to lend themselves very well to doing what I do.

### Finally, what is one piece of advice you would give anyone interested in starting their own design business?

Be prepared for the hardest work in your life. It will take everything you’ve got (and some things you think you didn’t have!) but you’ll only get out what you put in.
