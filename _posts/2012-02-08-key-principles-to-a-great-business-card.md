The game of opinion is always an interesting topic, what really makes a great business card? I guess that’s up to you to judge, and there is no right or wrong answer. But there are fundamental principles that I believe should be present within every business card design, and let your individual tastes and creativity do the rest. 

### Size

Let’s start with the basics, the foundation of your magnificent creation – the size. I once met someone who told me his card was the best, I was excited to see. He whipped it out and… It was like a birthday card, the thing was huge. It was at least 20% bigger than a regular sized business card, and didn’t even fit in my wallet. Business cards are renowned for being a throwaway item and you need to give people every reason to keep it. So why would someone create a business card that doesn’t fit in their wallet? Try stay away from this. Additionally, making your card too small leaves it open to being crumpled inside a wallet and contact details will degrade. Standard size, everytime.

### Branding and Logo Inclusion

It’s more than likely that your website contains some great branding to show off your identity, but do we really need to smother our business cards in it? I’m a firm believer that simple things often look the best, and when it comes to business cards, it’s vital that there is enough room to include all necessary contact details. Sacrificing your contact details to add some funky design doesn’t make a lot of sense. Give them a snapshot into your brand, not the whole entity. Your website and marketing collaterals can tell the full story of your brand, you need the customer first.

### Type

The most common mistake with the average business card is the glorious typeface. The one that looks cool at point size 10. You may think that the typeface you’re using looks smooth, clean and crisp, but if people can’t read it (think about your audience) you may as well not have anything on there.

### Colours

Let your branding flow and pay attention to the colours you use elsewhere. It’s important that the typeface you’re using matches or compliments the colour palette you’re using – this helps them fit in with the business card and creates a sense that the card was designed around the contact details, not the other way round. Focus on the type.

### “Not Creative Enough”

I was once told my business cards were not creative enough for what I specialise in. It’s important to take feedback like this carefully, and not react in a way that people think you’re a bit precious over your branding. Of course, you should be proud in what you’ve achieved and decided upon – after all, you’re the designer.
