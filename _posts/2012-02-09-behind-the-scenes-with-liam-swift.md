### What inspired you to start working in the creative industry?

I have always had an interest in brands. Since a kid I have been fascinated with logos, slogans, advertising, fashion, photography – anything creative basically.

I started off wanting to be a website designer until I dabbled in code and I quickly got bored. I loved Art as a kid and needed to do something that enabled me to draw more and looked into front end development of websites and then that evolved into being interested in identity and engagement.

Learning this fell into graphic design and the creative industry I knew from the age of say 13 – 14, what line of work I wanted to be in.

### Where do you see yourself in five years?

Where I am now. I love life at the minute. Obviously there are the old clichés of bigger house, nice car etc, but that will come when it comes. I have personal goals and business goals. I suppose in terms of Attract I would love to be in a bigger studio with a team around me and explore new areas of design.

### Describe your usual working day.

Up early and hit the gym at 7 followed by a swim and in the studio for around 8:30. Check emails and social media profiles. Then I write the all-important list (I will expand on this next). I tend to then work solid until I get hungry and grab something to eat, during this time I like to engage somehow, whether it be a phone call to a client or chat on Twitter to break away from the “work”.

Some days seem to merge and be identical and the rest are broken up into meetings, travel, contacting folk and networking.

### How do you stay focused during the day?

The list. Each day I write everything that needs doing and I mean everything. I star 3 important tasks and make sure these get done that day – anything else is a bonus. At the end of the day I can look back over the list and see what I have done and carry over the tasks that I haven’t.

The feeling you get when you have done something productive is very important when running your own company or freelancing. The list also helps you to identify tasks that are in the way or stopping you from doing something else that could help you reach specific goals.

### What’s your most exciting project to work on?

Retail branding. I had a good 5 years being a part of a big fashion chain’s retail management whilst at University. I enjoyed the interaction with customers and merchandising the store a particular way to improve profit etc.

Working with retail now is a hard challenge, as the high street is tough. But helping small retail chains make the transition to suit current buying habits or still attract customers to the store is an exciting project for me.

### What’s the hardest part of your job?

Switching off. I don’t think I have ever had a good nights sleep since I left University. My mind is constantly on, flicking through ideas for customers and myself. There have been numerous occasions where I wake up and jot everything down in my head just in case I forget it in the morning. That is the hardest part about being creative in my opinion.

### How do you think agency life differs to freelancing/self employment?

The comfort zone, that nice wage at the end of every month. Part of me misses that, but there is no greater feeling than working for yourself and being your own boss. Doing things your way and surviving at the same time. The great sense of achievement. *Pats self on the back*

### How much time a week do you allocate to personal skill development?

When I can. I like to incorporate new ideas and technologies into new projects and educate myself as well as my client. Collaboration is a big thing; I learn things so much quicker from someone else and actually seeing it being done. I am not afraid to identify people who are better than me either and work with them somehow.

### Do you pay attention to design trends – if so, how much?

I think you have to but it is important you don’t let trends distract you from the brief. We all read magazines and watch TV. We all go shopping and use the Internet – trends are being subconsciously fed into your mind whether you pay any attention or not.

Up till now, I seem to be good at spotting a trend before it starts – whether I use it or not is dependant on the client and suitability of their market.

### Do you think graphic design can be self-taught?

I think it can but you can’t teach yourself the talent and creativity it takes to be good at it. This for me is born with you or developed as a passion early on. You also have to love it – no good taking it up because you heard it pays well, clients will see through this.

### Do you feel up-and-coming creatives need a high level qualification to get hired?

No. When the time comes to me expanding, I would take an amazing portfolio over an amazing degree any day. I have a degree in design but I didn’t get my first design job because of it. I got my first design job because I submitted a creative cover letter, CV and tailored portfolio. No mention of my BA.

My CV was marketed around my passion for design. It showed whilst studying design at University I freelanced and built up a credible portfolio, as well as working all weekend as a retail manager.

### Finally, what is one piece of advice you would give anyone interested in becoming a designer?

Love it. What ever you decide to do in your working life, just love it. Enjoy getting up and don’t stress – a job isn’t worth it if you are unhappy and stressed.
