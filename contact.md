Chat to me about something, such as a speaking or workshop event.

I most likely will not respond to individual code queries, please defer to StackOverflow.

[Tweeting me](https://twitter.com/toddmotto) is the fastest way to get hold of me.

For anything else, email me through <a href="//voux.io/contact" target="_blank">Voux's contact form</a>.
