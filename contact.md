Chat to me about something, such as a speaking or workshop event.

I most likely will not respond to individual code queries, please defer to StackOverflow.

[Tweeting me](https://twitter.com/toddmotto) is the fastest way to get hold of me.

For anything else, email me on <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01rmKaZ2nEzUNTlBeJwIA-NA==&amp;c=de1XRgcu-NxBLsqf8jeHz_Fq-2QrJf1ZcDAozNqFuu8=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501rmKaZ2nEzUNTlBeJwIA-NA\75\75\46c\75de1XRgcu-NxBLsqf8jeHz_Fq-2QrJf1ZcDAozNqFuu8\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">[show email]</a>.
